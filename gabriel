Here we are, one week already, I think that nothing has changed, but is it true? See everything that you have done, 7 days alone, handled, sometimes enjoyed, sometimes anxious, sometimes sad, maybe this is life, you are living, I don’t know if I change place or I will stay here, I think here is nice, people seem nice, I just need to be a bit more approachable, smile more, speak more, just enjoy, nobody knows who you are, you can pretend if needed, create a character, you don’t need to open yourself. Gabriel, I am doing this for you, today I am living a life which you judge not nice hoping that one day you will be proud of me, I love you and I don’t your happiness, never forget that people come and people go but I will be always here for you. Everything that I do and learn it is to be better for you, stay with me, you say that you are a nice friend, but mainly a good friend for yourself, enjoy your time alone, laugh, cry, I will be always here, don’t forget that.

Hello, another day, I cant believe that it has passed already 9 days that I am here, it is passing soo fast, I cant see any difference yet, I don’t know if I have changed, if it is worth it, I feel that I am wasting my time and the rest of money that I still have. I don’t know if I will be able to back to Dublin, I don’t have money to pay the deposit and the rent, if I wait too much I wont have money even to pay for a temporary place, it is a shame the situation that you find yourself, it is really sad, I know you have people that would help you, but it is not fair to them, you made this, you create this problem, Margherita is there waiting for you to get better, you are not showing any sign of progress, it is quiet the opposite actually, and the minimum that you changed, I think if you were in Dublin with Margherita you would back to the same situation, always sad, always fighting, I believe that our relationship is finished, even if we are still believing on it, it does not seem that any of us is willing to give up in order to have a better life, I am here trying to change, but what about her? Is she also trying? Can she see that I may be the bigger problem but I am not the only one? I feel that I am the only one that would do anything to be better, every time I talk to her I feel that she is always the same, stuck in a short moment, forgetting the past and basing the future in a short present, we should look to our past, understand our problems and try to solve it. Actually it is kinda unfair to say that I haven’t changed at all, I feel a little bit different, but this felling that I have no future makes me so sad, so inconsequent, so stupid, I don’t know how enjoy the present, right now, I am always waiting for a future that I don’t know if it will arrive, I think I should stop waisting my money in driking and spend it looking for a psychologist, try to talk, ask for a opniao, I need to understand my self, I can let the mistakes of my past keep influenting in my life, I don’t need to live with my problems, I need to understand them and grow. Stop making your life so miserable, stop waiting for people to do what you want, you should be more communicative, you know that this is the key for you success, open you mouth, smile more, be open for the opportunities, you need to keep creating moments, even if you don’t like approaching people you should put yourself in situations where people would approach and then you talk, just talk, listen, make smart questions, try to curious about their lifes, you don’t know to give your opinion about everything, it is not a debate, it is a chat, in the same way that people will listen to you, you should listen to them, actually, listen more and make question, when asked about your opinion you can say something, but short, don’t make it a monologe, and don’t forget to live the conversation open, use key phrases, look for it on internet, you will find something for sure, be smart, use your main skill in order to be more sociable, you know how to use google/youtube, so use them to find phrases and conversation starts, it is not that hard, they are just human, come on, you can handle computers but you cant handle people? Anyway, I am here at a starbucks just to kill time and pretend that I am smart, lol, actually I am, more weird then smart, but still, you could be also ugly. Enjoy your day.

Hi Gabriel, how are you feeling today? Well, I am always kind of weird, but I think it will be a nice day, I decided yesterday that I will stay for another 3 nights, hopefully it will get better, I mean, it is already really good, but it can always get better, I wish I could meet and talk to more people, I have met really great people in the past day, I need to stop saying that Lisbon is not nice, it is actually really nice, if there is a problem, it is you, you are trying, I can see it, baby steps, like always, I think you are living your comfort zone, it is great, I feel great, it is something I was not expecting to be honest, I have come here with a bit of expectation but I end up being better then I imagined, it is a good opportunity to learn, the people that you met are full of stories, experience, really cool people, there is no much to learn from them, I just need to listen more, ask more, be interested in their stories, use this time to do it, enjoy every moment and keep creating new opportunities, you will see that it will be a great experience, stay with yourself for a bit, think about your life, you next steps, start a course, learn something new, something that you can use to get a new job, anything, you will be free next week, I need to plan what I am going to do next week, I cant stay living so randomly, actually I can, I am just not thinking that it is a good idea, you should just jump in a new life, I don’t know if I should go back to Dublin, maybe to make some money and then I can leave again, it would be great if I could stay here, why don’t you volunteer to stay in the hostel, it would be really crazy to do something like this, crazy but irresponsible, it would stay it should be an experience to help you be always better, not a waste of time, not only to party, but a lesson for you life, look at the people that you met, you are the blessed for what you have and how you are, you are just still thinking that you are trash, you are not, let people say that you are not, you would not attract some many good people if you weren’t, stop thinking bad about yourself, start loving yourself more, take care of your mind, live the moment always thinking about the future, you are sitting at a starbucks writing and having a nice coffee, also working, for now yes, I know it will end, and this is an opportunity to get something better, start applying for other positions, look for something here, maybe you can stay, here is nice, the adaptation would be that hard, you need a space to restart, he seems nice, stay for few months, take the documents, start a new life, after you can leave, in the end you are alone in this world, it will be always only you, and it is also good, it is what I wanted, don’t get attached to anybody or anyone, you are full of nice stories, you don’t need anything if you have yourself, enjoy life, enjoy, wake up, you are not depressive, put this in your mind, you are happy, an adventure, a traveler, two weeks already out, traveling around the world, it is really cool man, everybody says it, everybody sees it, I know it is something yours, but never forget that shared happiness is double happiness, smile more.

Margherita must be really sad, she went to USA without talking to me, even a bye, I understand her, I just don’t think she understand me, she will one day, the problem is what is happening today, the way it happened, we have said goodbye, it is better giving the situation we are, I was not happy, I have tried to explain so many times, she is not open for what I needed, she is a nice friend, maybe a good partner too, she didn’t now how to handle everything, that is the open mind I always say she misses, we were wrong, we tried, it didn’t word, it is fair to ask for a break, it may be temporary or not, so that is the reason why you should make it worth it, don’t waste your time or hers, don’t be blocked for anything, you own her respect and not your life, she is there today and you are here, you see that if you give up on yourself she will not be there to help you, she wants something that you can not give, I don’t think that I wished to be that, I the worst is that I have lost myself trying to be somebody else, it is not fair to yourself, you are kind of sad and not happy, but it is not an options, as you can see, you can be anything, it is just a matter of stimulation, think that thoughts become things and the law of attraction really exists, she will not want to stay with me as a friend and this will not change my feelings for her, I don’t have anger or hate in my heart, it will be understood one day, she will get my point I hope.
